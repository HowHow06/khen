## Troubleshooting

## Error faced in using jest

- When using yarn v1 with jest, it might be fine on the first `yarn install`. However, when new dependencies are added, the `yarn test` will no longer works.
- As workaround, the code below is added to the `package.json` file
  ```
  "resolutions": {
    "wrap-ansi": "7.0.0",
    "string-width": "4.2.3"
  }
  ```
- OR another workaround is to use `npm` instead of yarn
- OR another workaround is to delete the `yarn.lock` file
